# ðŸ“œ userscripts
User scripts that make my web browsing better.

Good user interfaces should
- do what I want by default,
- or if not by default, at least let me choose what I want,
- and when I tell it what I want, the UI should remember that and not make me perform the same annoying actions every single time I use it.

Bad user interfaces
- are annoying,
- are inefficient,
- are ugly,
- are defective,
- are dangerous,
- don't handle exceptional situations,
- forget my choices,
- or don't give me choices in the first place.

## Installation
1. Install a user script extension in your browser. Some available implementations to pick from:
    - [**Tampermonkey**](https://tampermonkey.net/) works in [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com), Chrome, Firefox, Edge (not IE), Safari, and Opera.
    - [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/get-it/) works in [Vivaldi](https://vivaldi.com), Chrome, Firefox, and Opera.
    - [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) works in Firefox.
1. Click the site name in the [table below](#targeted-websites).
    - Alternately, you can open the user script file from this repository that you want, then click the Raw button.
1. On the Tampermonkey page that appears, click the **Install** button.
1. If the targeted website is already open, reload it to make the user script start running immediately. Otherwise, it will start the next time you load the site.

*Instructions were written for Tampermonkey 5.3. Other extensions may need different steps.*

## Targeted websites

|Site|Changes|
|-|-|
|[Bluesky](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/bluesky.user.js)|Hide self-reposts.|
|[Create Passkeys Anywhere](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/create-passkeys-anywhere.user.js)|Always allow you to choose whether newly created passkeys should be stored on either USB security keys (roaming authenticators) or the TPM (platform).|
|[Freshping](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/freshping.user.js)|Show 90 day uptime reports by default, instead of only the current day.|
|[Google Images](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/google-images.user.js)|Always search for Large sizes in Google Images, instead of having to always click Tools â€º Size â€º Large every time you change the query.|
|[Newegg](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/newegg.user.js)|Allow you to load order history for any year, not just the last 10 years.|
|[Nixplay](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/nixplay.user.js)|Increase the maximum concurrent file upload limit from 3 to 24, because it spends most of its time idle while waiting for S3 instead of saturating my uplink.|
|[Pandora](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/pandora-now-playing.user.js)|Show the currently playing artist and song title in the Pandora document title.|
|[Splitwise](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/splitwise.user.js)|If you're entering a long list of items in an itemized expense and accidentally hit `Esc` at any time, Splitwise will lose all of the data you have entered without prompting you or saving a backup. This fixes that defect, so hitting `Esc` will do nothing. Also prevent you from accidentally entering a comma in an itemized amount textbox when you intended to enter a period, leading to confusing and hard-to-spot miscalculations.|
|[TP-Link AX20](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/tplink.user.js)|Block broken redirections to the wrong IP address every time the router login page loads.|
|[Twitch](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/twitch.user.js)|Automatically claim channel points. Suppress ads with black video and muted audio. Automatically recover from player errors. Prevent video resolution from decreasing when the page is idle or backgrounded.|
|[Twitter chronological timeline](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/twitter-chronological.user.js)|Show tweets on the home timeline in the order they were posted, not For You.|
|[Twitter disable auto-reloading](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/twitter-disable-auto-reloading.user.js)|Stop the web interface from showing new tweets and reloading all the time. Click the Home button to manually load new tweets.|
|[Twitter demusking](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/twitter-font-2022.user.js)|Revert the [font changes that were made on 2023-01-26](https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/26/23572746/twitter-changed-font-impersonators) (Chirp got a higher x-height, terminal on `l`, serifs on `I`, and slash on `0`).<br>Revert the [logo and title changes that were made on 2023-07-24](https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/24/23805415/twitter-x-logo-rebrand-bird-farewell-to-birds).|

|[YouTube](https://github.com/Aldaviva/userscripts/raw/master/force-youtube-theater-mode.user.js)|When watching a YouTube video, force the page into Theater Mode, where the video's width expands to also include the Related Videos column on the right. YouTube does a terrible job of remembering the most-recently-used Theater mode state.|
